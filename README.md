# Cryptocurrency Clustering

This project explores the clustering of cryptocurrencies based on their market data, such as price change percentages. The goal is to group cryptocurrencies that have similar behaviors and understand market trends. The project leverages data transformation, visualization, and unsupervised machine learning techniques to achieve these objectives.

## Project Overview

The project utilizes cryptocurrency data to perform clustering analysis. The data is first cleaned, transformed, and then visualized to identify trends in price changes over different periods. Using clustering techniques, cryptocurrencies with similar characteristics are grouped, providing insights into their market behaviors.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and handling.
- **Hvplot**: For interactive plotting of market data.
- **Scikit-learn**: For clustering analysis.
- **Bokeh**: For interactive visualizations.
- **Panel**: For enhancing interactivity in visualizations.
